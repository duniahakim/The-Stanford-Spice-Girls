### A synopsis of our project

Ideas Include:

- Apple Music to Spotify: A web application that will download your entire Apple Music library and upload all songs to Spotify and vice versa.

- Substitute teacher app: A web app to connect substitute teachers to schools that need them. Teachers could have ratings, possibly have a forum where both parties can connect. 

- Education material compilation: A web app that compiles materials for teachers (or in this day and age, for students and their parents). Materials would be gathered from the web, would need to be sure materials aren't copyrighted.
